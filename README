primegen.go is a Go package that generates prime numbers in order using the
Sieve of Atkin instead of the traditional Sieve of Eratosthenes.

It is a relatively straightforward port of D. J. Bernstein's original
C implementation (http://cr.yp.to/primegen.html) but makes use of
Go's concurrency features which should make it faster on multi-core CPUs.

Do "go get github.com/divergentdave/primegen" to install the package.

View the package documentation online at
http://gopkgdoc.appspot.com/pkg/github.com/divergentdave/primegen
or on the command line by running "go doc github.com/divergentdave/primegen".

The repository includes two additional programs that illustrate usage of the
primegen package:

  1. primes, which writes prime numbers to standard out
  2. primespeed, which prints the time taken to generate the first
     50,847,534 prime numbers

(This was forked by David Cook to change the package name. As of ca. 2012,
repository names can no longer end in .go, to disambiguate between local files
and source controlled projects)
